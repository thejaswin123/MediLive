<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
***We are living in the era of fast internet and technology which has been never lived before. but even due to this fast moving technologies we are often having several issues related with the healthcare such as - ***

- Many people face a lot issue's for maintaining a health record for themselves . Let it be medical report's , doctor's prescription or clinical result's.(which is very mandatory for people with disorder and cardiac diseases. )
- People also face a lot problem while making appointed to different doctor's. (they have to travel there and make an appointment ).
- Many people's face difficulties for receiving their instant medical report's from the hospital as  people have to visit the diagnostic centers or hospital's to get their  medical report's. 
- For getting a diagnostic cost of a center you wouldn't be able to get the detail's of the clinical trail's of that department. 

### Solution to the problem
An encrypted database authenticated by the user - 

- The user could be able to register in the platform with 2-factor authentication. 
- each user will have a unique  UID .
- the user can make his health-record visible to other's based on his preference. 
- healthcare departments  can have contact with the user  based on their UID.

### What we provide

- The user can receive their checkup detail's and prescription .
- The user can upload their personal health record's to make it accessible for future purposes.(specially for people with disorder's and cardiac diseases)
- The user can also receive medical report's on the platform from the health-care department  which would be very beneficial for people living in different cities or far distant places. 
- The health-department can access user all previous health-record to do better analysis . 
- The user can book appointment to doctor from any place around the globe. (now don't say we already have medlife or practo for online checkup, then let me tell you that you can't taste a biryani by it's  photo ).
- A portal to find nearest health center.
- A 24/7 online emergency department
- A FAQ and Blog section

### Challenges
 
 - Capital requirement
 - Pre-existing player in the market
 - Privacy concern
 - Linkage of health department
